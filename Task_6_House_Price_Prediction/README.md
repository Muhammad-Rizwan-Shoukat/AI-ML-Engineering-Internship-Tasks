# House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting house prices using a machine learning regression
model. The notebook demonstrates a complete workflow including data loading,
preprocessing, categorical feature encoding, model training, and evaluation using
housing-related features.

---

## Objective
The objectives of this project are:
- To analyze housing data and understand key price-influencing factors
- To preprocess numerical and categorical features
- To build a regression model for house price prediction
- To evaluate model performance on unseen data

---

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains housing-related attributes such as:

| Feature | Description |
|------|------------|
| sqft_living | Living area size (square feet) |
| bedrooms | Number of bedrooms |
| bathrooms | Number of bathrooms |
| city | City where the house is located |
| price | House price (target variable) |

## Methodology
1. Dataset loading and inspection  
2. Handling missing values  
3. Feature selection  
4. Encoding categorical variables using One-Hot Encoding  
5. Train-test split  
6. Regression model training and evaluation
