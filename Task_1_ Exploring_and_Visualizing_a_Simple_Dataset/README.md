# Iris Dataset Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Project Overview
This project performs an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the classic Iris dataset,
which contains measurements of iris flowers from three different species. The notebook
focuses on understanding the dataset structure, exploring feature relationships, and
identifying patterns that help distinguish between species using data visualization
techniques.

---

## Objective
The main objectives of this project are:
- To understand the structure and distribution of the Iris dataset
- To explore relationships between different features
- To identify key features that differentiate iris species
- To build a strong analytical foundation for future machine learning tasks

---

## Dataset Description
The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples with the following features:

| Feature | Description |
|------|------------|
| Sepal Length | Length of the sepal (cm) |
| Sepal Width | Width of the sepal (cm) |
| Petal Length | Length of the petal (cm) |
| Petal Width | Width of the petal (cm) |
| Species | Iris flower species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) |

## Tools and Libraries Used
- Python  
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

---

## Methodology
The analysis follows these steps:
1. Data loading and inspection
2. Data preprocessing and summary statistics
3. Exploratory data analysis using visualizations
4. Interpretation of results and insights extraction

---

## Key Findings
- Petal length and petal width are the most significant features for species separation
- Iris Setosa is clearly distinguishable from the other species
- Versicolor and Virginica show partial overlap, especially in sepal features
- The dataset is clean and well-suited for classification problems
