# Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict the presence
of heart disease using patient medical data. The notebook covers data loading,
preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature scaling, and model training to
demonstrate a complete machine learning workflow.

## Objective
The objectives of this project are:
- To analyze and preprocess heart disease medical data
- To explore relationships between clinical features
- To train a machine learning model for heart disease prediction
- To evaluate model performance using standard metrics

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains medical attributes related to heart health, including:

| Feature | Description |
|------|------------|
| Age | Age of the patient |
| Sex | Gender of the patient |
| Chest Pain Type | Type of chest pain experienced |
| Resting Blood Pressure | Blood pressure level |
| Cholesterol | Serum cholesterol level |
| Max Heart Rate | Maximum heart rate achieved |
| Target | Presence or absence of heart disease |
